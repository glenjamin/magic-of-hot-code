 * Separation of state from behaviour


 * Closures are state


 * JS Modules are closures



















 * The solution: Late binding
























"OOP to me means only messaging, local retention, and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other systems in which this is possible, but I'm not aware of them."

                                - Alan Kay


















To generalise this a bit,


The best hot reloadable code:


    * Is mostly pure


    * Protects its state


    * Uses late binding


















  The more declarative, the better!
